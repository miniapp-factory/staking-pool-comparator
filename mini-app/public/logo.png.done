A stylized, modern logo featuring a stylized coin icon with a network of interconnected nodes representing multiple blockchains. The coin is centered, with a gradient from deep blue to teal, and a subtle glow. Around the coin, thin lines radiate outward, forming a subtle hexagonal pattern that hints at network connectivity. The background is a clean, light gray gradient that gives depth without distracting from the central icon. The overall composition conveys trust, connectivity, and the idea of comparing and optimizing staking opportunities across chains.
