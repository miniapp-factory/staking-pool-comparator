App Name: Staking Pool Comparator

Description:
Staking Pool Comparator is a Mini App that compares staking pools across multiple blockchains and protocols. Analyze APYs, lock-up periods, risks, validator performance, and reward frequency to find the best staking opportunities. Get alerts when top pools change their rates or when new high-yield pools appear.

Key Features:
 • Comparison of APYs and reward structures across pools
 • Monitoring of validator performance and pool reliability
 • Alerts for APY changes or new staking opportunities
 • Risk indicators based on protocol and validator metrics
 • Dashboard to track selected pools and optimize staking strategies

Use Case:
Perfect for crypto holders and yield-focused investors who want to maximize returns by choosing the best and safest staking pools.

I need the current contents of **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** so I can update the title and description.  
Please add that file to the chat.

A stylized, modern logo featuring a stylized coin icon with a network of interconnected nodes representing multiple blockchains. The coin is centered, with a gradient from deep blue to teal, and a subtle glow. Around the coin, thin lines radiate outward, forming a subtle hexagonal pattern that hints at network connectivity. The background is a clean, light gray gradient that gives depth without distracting from the central icon. The overall composition conveys trust, connectivity, and the idea of comparing and optimizing staking opportunities across chains.
